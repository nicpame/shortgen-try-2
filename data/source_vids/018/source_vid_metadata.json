    "description": "Did you know there‚Äôs a river on Earth that flows backwards every six months?\n\nSounds impossible, right? But it‚Äôs true. And this natural phenomenon happens in Southeast Asia.\n\nMeet the Tonl√© Sap River, located in Cambodia.\n\nFor half the year, it flows south into the mighty Mekong River.\n\nBut when the monsoon rains arrive, the Mekong River expands more than five times its usual size, pushing the river water back, and forcing the Tonl√© Sap to go the other direction and flow north‚Äîfilling up a massive freshwater lake.\n\nAnd this natural reversal isn‚Äôt just a strange anomaly. It‚Äôs vital for life in the region, as the expanding lake creates one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world, feeding millions of people.\n\nSo while all the other rivers only flow in one direction, the Tonl√© Sap listens to the sky‚Ä¶ And when the rain tells it to turn around‚Äîit does.",
