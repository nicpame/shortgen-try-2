These electricians not only have to climb with almost no safety protection, but also navigate complex terrain, constantly facing the risk of falling. To save time, they have to eat and even rest while suspended in the air. Sometimes, they must maintain their balance in unstable positions. This is not only a test of physical fitness, but also a psychological challenge. In summer, they endure the scorching heat of the sun, While in winter, the danger doubles as the icy power lines become slippery, requiring extreme caution with every step. Moreover, the temperature difference between day and night at such heights is huge, making it easy to lose balance. More importantly, the thousands of volts of electricity themselves pose a tremendous danger. One small mistake can cause burns or even death. High-voltage electricity also produces arc discharge, which can strike even without direct contact. Therefore, despite the high salary, many people give up this job. If it were you,",

A giant disc with edges you could fall off. So, what if they were right? For starters, the continents would stretch across a flat plane. And Antarctica would be a towering ice wall wrapped around the edges, holding the oceans in like a frozen rim. But the laws of nature would break almost immediately. Gravity wouldn't pull straight down anymore. The farther you move from the center, the more sideways it pours, triggering massive tsunamis in the oceans, collapsing mountains, and thinning the air near the edges. Even the sky above would change as the sun wouldn't rise and set. It would circle above like a spotlight, lighting some places more than others. This would confuse seasonal cycles and throw time zones into chaos. And forget flying planes. You see, planes rely on GPS. And GPS only works because satellites stay in orbit. Without Earth's constant gravitational pull, these satellites would just drift into space.",

Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, all crashing back together into one giant piece of land. If that happened, sea levels would plummet, and hidden places like Zealandia, the sunken continent beneath New Zealand, could rise back above water, creating a new landmass almost the size of Australia. But geography wouldn't be the only thing to change. Peaceful oceans that once separated rival nations would be gone. The U.S. might suddenly share land borders with Morocco. Australia could merge with Southeast Asia. And Canada could touch parts of Portugal and Spain. New neighbors could mean new disputes over land, resources, and borders that no one ever agreed on. trade routes would collapse, and global shipping would have to reinvent itself.

And this natural phenomenon happens in Southeast Asia.\n\nMeet the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River, located in Cambodia.\n\nFor half the year, it flows south into the mighty Mekong River.\n\nBut when the monsoon rains arrive, the Mekong River expands more than five times its usual size, pushing the river water back, and forcing the Tonl\u00e9 Sap to go the other direction and flow north\u2014filling up a massive freshwater lake.\n\nAnd this natural reversal isn\u2019t just a strange anomaly. It\u2019s vital for life in the region, as the expanding lake creates one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world, feeding millions of people.\n\nSo while all the other rivers only flow in one direction, the Tonl\u00e9 Sap listens to the sky\u2026 And when the rain tells it to turn around\u2014it does.",

Meet the Tonle Sap River, located in Cambodia. For half the year, it flows south into the mighty Mekong River. But when the monsoon rains arrive, the Mekong River expands more than five times its usual size, pushing the river water back and forcing the Tonle Sap to go the other direction and flow north, filling up a massive freshwater lake. And this natural reversal isn't just a strange anomaly. It's vital for life in the region, as the expanding lake creates one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world, feeding millions of people. So, while all the other rivers only flow in one direction, the Tonle Sap listens to the sky. And when the rain tells it to turn around, it does.",

You see, the Amazon is one of the longest rivers in the world, stretching over 7,000 kilometers from east to west. That's almost as long as the Nile, which, by the way, has over 100 bridges crossing it. So why hasn't anyone built even one bridge here? Well, the main reason isn't just geography, but what lies under the ground. Scientists recently discovered a second river deep below the Amazon called the Hamza River. This hidden underground river makes the ground above it soft and unstable, making large-scale construction nearly impossible. Also, during the rainy season, the Amazon can get really wide. It can expand from just one or two kilometers to almost 50 kilometers across, turning it into the most unpredictable river in the world.",

Your specialization is in preparing written Persian text for high-fidelity Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. You have a deep understanding of Persian phonetics, grammar, and the correct application of diacritics (\u0627\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628).\n\nObjective: Your primary task is to process a given raw Persian text script and make it \"TTS-ready.\" This involves two main actions:\n\nVocalization (\u0627\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628\u200c\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u06cc): Add all necessary Persian diacritics to every word to remove any pronunciation ambiguity.\nPunctuation (\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a\u200c\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u06cc): Add or correct punctuation to guide the TTS engine in creating natural pauses, rhythm, and intonation.\nCore Instructions:\n\nAdd Diacritics: You must meticulously add the correct diacritics to the text. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nFat\u1e25a (\u0640\u064e / \u0632\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0631)\nKasra (\u0640\u0650 / \u0632\u06cc\u0631)\n\u1e0camma (\u0640\u064f / \u067e\u06cc\u0634)\nSuk\u016bn (\u0640\u0652 / \u0633\u06a9\u0648\u0646)\nTashd\u012bd (\u0640\u0651 / \u062a\u0634\u062f\u06cc\u062f)\nTanv\u012bn (\u0640\u064b, \u0640\u064d, \u0640\u064c)\nAdd Punctuation: Analyze the grammatical structure and meaning of the sentences to insert appropriate punctuation. This includes:\n\nPeriod / Full Stop (.) at the end of declarative sentences.\nComma (\u060c or ,) for separating clauses, items in a list, or for natural pauses.\nQuestion Mark (\u061f or ?) at the end of questions.\nExclamation Mark (!) for exclamatory sentences.\nColon (:) and Semicolon (\u061b) where grammatically appropriate.\nCrucial Constraints:\n\nDo NOT alter the text: You must not change any words, their order, or the meaning of the original script.\nPreserve Integrity: The original text must remain 100% intact. Your only job is to add diacritics and punctuation, not to edit or rephrase.\nCompleteness: Every single word that requires diacritics for unambiguous pronunciation must be vocalized. Do not leave common words un-vocalized.\nExample:\n\nInput Text: \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0645 \u062a\u0627 \u062f\u0631\u0633 \u0628\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0645\n\nExpected Output: \u0645\u064e\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u064e\u062f\u0631\u0650\u0633\u0650\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0631\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0645 \u062a\u0627 \u062f\u064e\u0631\u0633 \u0628\u0650\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0645.\n\nInput Text: \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0686\u0637\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc\n\nExpected Output: \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0686\u0650\u0637\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u061f \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u061f\n\n\n\n**Input Format:**\nThe orignal script is divided into segments, where each segment typically represents one sentence or natural speech unit.\n\n**Required Output Format:**\nReturn your script as a valid JSON object.
