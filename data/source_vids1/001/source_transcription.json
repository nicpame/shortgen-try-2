Then, 10 years later, as he was out fishing on his boat, he was again struck by lightning. But this time, he wasn't hurt and instead regained use of his legs. A couple years later, he was out walking in the park when he was once again struck, completely paralyzing and yawning. And then his gravestone was destroyed by another lightning strike.",
