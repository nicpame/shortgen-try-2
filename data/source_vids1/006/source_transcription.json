  "text": " What is the dumbest death ever? You might think it'd be something like what happened to these sports fans, who refused to pay the $37 entrance fee to a college football game. Instead, they climbed up on the roof of a nearby factory. But since the roof wasn't made to support 200 people, it collapsed, causing half of them to fall into a furnace. But surprisingly, that doesn't even come close to the dumbest death ever. Not even what happened to King Alexander comes close, who ran out of his palace to break up a fight between his dog and one of his monkeys. However, his other monkey decided to back up his bro and bit Alexander, killing him. You see, the dumbest way to ever die has to be what happened to Kenneth McCullough. Kenneth was working as a pilot during World War II and was taking off on a night bombing mission in Australia. However, just as the plane was taking off, a kangaroo jumped in front of the runway. Unfortunately, the kangaroo set off some of the bombs that the plane was carrying, and he blew up.",
